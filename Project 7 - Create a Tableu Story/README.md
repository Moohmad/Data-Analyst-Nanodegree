# Project 7 - Create a Tableau Story (Baseball Dataset)

## Overview

In this project, I will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. I will create an explanatory data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns in a data set. My work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
