# Project 5 - Explore and Summarize Data

## Overview

In this project, I will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques in a dataset to discover relationships among multiple variables, and create explanatory visualizations illuminating distributions, outliers, and anomalies. With an objective of finding Which chemical properties influence the quality of white wines.

## Dataset

This tidy data set contains 4,898 white wines with 13 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
