# Project 4 - Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

## Overview

In this project, I will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). The Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task.
I will make an experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. I will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, I will interpret results in terms of the hypotheses.
