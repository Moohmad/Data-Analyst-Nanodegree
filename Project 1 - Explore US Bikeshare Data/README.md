# Project 1 - Explore US Bikeshare Data

## Overview

In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC.
 I will be performing data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics and then visualize it.

## Dataset
